## Where is the directory for Arduino libraries?

You can find and modify the directory path for Arduino libraries by selecting `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` > `Sketchbook location` from the menu bar in the Arduino IDE.

## How to Install ESP32_Display_Panel in Arduino IDE?

- If you want to install online, navigate to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries...` in the Arduino IDE, then search for `ESP32_Display_Panel` and click the `Install` button to install it.
- If you want to install manually, download the required version of the `.zip` file from [ESP32_Display_Panel](https://github.com/esp-arduino-libs/ESP32_Display_Panel), then navigate to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Add .ZIP Library...` in the Arduino IDE, select the downloaded `.zip` file, and click `Open` to install it.
- You can also refer to the guides on library installation in the [Arduino IDE v1.x.x](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries) or [Arduino IDE v2.x.x](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/ide-v2-installing-a-library) documentation.

## Where are the installation directory for arduino-esp32 and the SDK located?

The default installation path for arduino-esp32 depends on your operating system:

- Windows: `C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\esp32`
- Linux: `~/.arduino15/packages/esp32`

The SDK for arduino-esp32 v3.x.x version is located in the `tools/esp32-arduino-libs/idf-release_x` directory within the default installation path.

## How to fix screen drift issue when driving RGB LCD with ESP32-S3?

When encountering screen drift issue when driving RGB LCD with ESP32-S3, you can follow these steps to resolve them:

1. **Refer to Documentation**: Understand the issue description in detail, you can refer to [this document](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-faq/en/latest/software-framework/peripherals/lcd.html#why-do-i-get-drift-overall-drift-of-the-display-when-esp32-s3-is-driving-an-rgb-lcd-screen).

2. **Enable `Bounce Buffer + XIP on PSRAM` Feature**: To resolve the issue, it's recommended to enable the `Bounce Buffer + XIP on PSRAM` feature. Follow these steps:

   - **Step 1**: Download the "high_perf" version of the SDK from [arduino-esp32-sdk](https://github.com/esp-arduino-libs/arduino-esp32-sdk) and replace it in the [installation directory of arduino-esp32](#where-are-the-installation-directory-for-arduino-esp32-and-the-sdk-located).

   - **Step 2**: If you are using supported development boards, usually there's no need to modify the code as they set `ESP_PANEL_LCD_RGB_BOUNCE_BUF_SIZE` to `(ESP_PANEL_LCD_WIDTH * 10)` by default. If the issue persists, refer to the example code below to increase the size of the `Bounce Buffer`.

   - **Step 3**: If you are using a custom board, confirm in the `ESP_Panel_Board_Custom.h` file whether `ESP_PANEL_LCD_RGB_BOUNCE_BUF_SIZE` is set to non-zero. If the issue persists, increase the size of the `Bounce Buffer`.

   - **Step 4**: If you are using an independent driver, refer to the example code below to set the size of the `Bounce Buffer`.

   - **Step 5**: If you are developing an LVGL application, assign the task that initializes the RGB peripheral and the task that runs the LVGL `lv_timer_handler()` on the same core. Please refer to [the code](../examples/LVGL/v8/Porting/lvgl_port_v8.h#L53).

3. **Example Code**: The following example code demonstrates how to modify the size of the `Bounce Buffer` using `ESP_Panel` driver or independent driver:

   **Example 1**: Modify the `Bounce Buffer` size using the `ESP_Panel` driver:

    ```c
    ...
    ESP_Panel *panel = new ESP_Panel();
    panel->init();
    // Start
    ESP_PanelBus_RGB *rgb_bus = static_cast<ESP_PanelBus_RGB *>(panel->getLcd()->getBus());
    // The size of the bounce buffer must satisfy `width_of_lcd * height_of_lcd = size_of_buffer * N`, where N is an even number.
    rgb_bus->configRgbBounceBufferSize((ESP_PANEL_LCD_WIDTH * 20));
    // End
    panel->begin();
    ...
    ```

   **Example 2**: Modify the `Bounce Buffer` size using an independent driver:

    ```c
    ...
    ESP_PanelBus_RGB *lcd_bus = new ESP_PanelBus_RGB(...);
    // Start
    // The size of the bounce buffer must satisfy `width_of_lcd * height_of_lcd = size_of_buffer * N`, where N is an even number.
    lcd_bus->configRgbBounceBufferSize(EXAMPLE_LCD_WIDTH * 10);
    // End
    lcd_bus->begin();
    ...
    ```

## How to Use ESP32_Display_Panel on PlatformIO?

You can refer to the example [PlatformIO](../examples/PlatformIO/) to use the ESP32_Display_Panel library in PlatformIO. By default, it is suitable for the **ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-Board** and **ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-Board-2** development boards. You need to modify the [boards/ESP-LCD.json](../examples/PlatformIO/boards/ESP-LCD.json) file according to the actual situation.
